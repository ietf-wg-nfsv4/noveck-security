# NFSv4 Noveck Security Draft

This is draft to propose security improvements to NFSv4.1/v4.2.  This draft
attempts a comprehensive review of all aspects of current security
mechanisms and relates to efforts on RFC 5661bis to clean up on possible
areas where v4.1/4.2 are possibly underspecified to increase compatibility
of confirming NFS implementations.
